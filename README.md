# Introduction
Wordle is a popular online word guessing game run by the New York Times where players have six attempts to guess a secret five-letter word. The game generates a new random word each round and provides feedback to the player after each guess, indicating which letters are correct and in the right position, and which letters are correct but in the wrong position. The objective of the game is to correctly guess the word within the six attempts provided.
